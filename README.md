# Image Upload and PDF Generation

This project consists of a PHP script designed to securely handle the upload of image files (a logo and a barcode) and use them to generate a customized PDF document. The PDF creation is powered by the **FPDF** library, while image processing and security enhancements are managed with the **GD** library.

## Key Features

  * **Secure File Upload:** Implements stringent controls for image uploads, including strict validation of the file's actual MIME type and a file size limit to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
  * **Threat Neutralization:** Uploaded images are re-processed by the GD library, which strips out any malicious metadata or embedded code. This sanitizes the file and ensures only the visual content of the image is stored.
  * **Temporary File Management:** Files are saved with unique names to prevent file collisions and overwrites. Once the PDF is generated and downloaded, the temporary files are automatically cleaned up, keeping the system tidy and secure.
  * **Dynamic PDF Generation:** Creates a PDF with a predefined layout, dynamically embedding the logo and a placeholder for a barcode, based on user input.
  * **Error Logging:** Utilizes `error_log` to record any failures during file upload or processing, which is crucial for auditing and debugging.

-----

## System Requirements

To run this script, your web server environment must include:

  * **PHP 7.4+** or newer.
  * The **GD extension** for PHP enabled.
  * The **Fileinfo extension** for PHP enabled.
  * The **FPDF** library (already included in the `fpdf` directory).

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ fpdf/             # FPDF library
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fpdf.php
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ images/           # Static images directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logo.jpeg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ temp_uploads/     # Temporary directory for uploads (must not be publicly accessible)
â”œâ”€â”€ generar.php       # Main PHP script
â””â”€â”€ index.html        # User interface form
```

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1.  Ensure all system requirements are installed and configured.
2.  Place the project files in the root directory of your web server.
3.  Ensure the `temp_uploads` directory has write permissions (we recommend `0755` or more restrictive permissions for enhanced security) so the server can save the uploaded files.
4.  Access the `index.html` file via your browser. The form on this page serves as the interface for uploading files. The form action is configured to send the data to the `generar.php` script for processing.

### Updated HTML Form (index.html)

The user interface form has been optimized for **improved usability and accessibility**. The use of `<label for="...">` and `<input id="...">` explicitly links form labels to their respective input fields, improving usability for all users. The binary `select` input was replaced with a cleaner `checkbox` for a more intuitive user experience.
